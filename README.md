## Visualization

Here are some visualizations representing my learning journey and interests:

### Python Data Analysis

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example data
categories = ['Data Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Web Development', 'Cloud Computing']
hours = [50, 30, 20, 15]

# Plotting a bar chart
plt.bar(categories, hours)
plt.xlabel('Categories')
plt.ylabel('Hours Spent')
plt.title('My Learning Journey')
plt.show()
